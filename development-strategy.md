# RESTFUL-COURSES: development strategy

---

## 0. Setup

- created `index.js`, `development-strategy.md`, installed express framework for node.js, initialized `README.md`.

---

## 1. User Story: `GET request, retrieve courses`

- Using express framework, I can run up a server in the local machine listening for HTTP requests through an specified port number.
- User must be able to fetch information from the server using REST  API commands, the server must process the request and give back a response with all or one precise course id.
- the file `index.js` add the functionality to process incoming GET requests `/`, `/api/courses` and `/api/courses/:id`.
